Shared preToolUse hook: keep the shell READ-ONLY for non-developer agents.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  An agent's `write` tool is path-restricted (toolsSettings.write.allowedPaths) and the
  `fs_write` hook (check-write-path.py) enforces those globs. But the `shell` / executeBash
  tool bypasses all of that — it can mutate the filesystem through:
    - redirection to a real file:   echo x > src/app.ts   ·   foo >> file   ·   ... | tee f
    - in-place editors:             sed -i ... · perl -i ...
    - an interpreter eval:          node -e "fs.writeFileSync(...)"  ·  python3 -c "open(...,'w')"
    - file ops:                     cp / mv / rm / touch / mkdir / dd / truncate / ln / install
    - working-tree mutation:        git add/commit/checkout/restore/reset/stash · patch
  Only the DEVELOPER agent (S4) may write code. The orchestrators and the read-phase agents
  must treat the shell as read-only for the filesystem — they run guards (node .kiro/tools/*.mjs),
  openspec, and read-only inspection (cat/grep/ls/…). They write artifacts ONLY via the
  path-guarded `write` tool, never via the shell.

DUAL-PLATFORM (one source, two hosts):
  • Kiro  — each agent wires its own hook and passes the agent NAME as argv[1]:
      "preToolUse": [ { "matcher": "execute_bash",
        "command": "python3 .kiro/agents/scripts/check-shell-command.py <agent>",
        "timeout_ms": 3000 } ]
    (Today only sdlc-full / sdlc-fast wire this; the developer agent has no shell guard.)
  • Claude Code — ONE PreToolUse(Bash) hook in .claude/settings.json fires for EVERY actor with
    NO argv. The acting role arrives in the stdin JSON as `agent_type` — present only when a
    Task-spawned subagent acts, ABSENT when the MAIN SESSION (the orchestrator) acts:
      { "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [ { "type": "command",
          "command": "python3 .claude/agents/scripts/check-shell-command.py" } ] }
    Because the single hook sees all actors, it grants the developer exception INTERNALLY and
    treats the main session (no agent_type) as the read-only orchestrator.

ACTOR → CLASS → POLICY (identical regex denylist for both hosts):
  developer                              → ALLOW (the only code-writing role; full shell)
  orchestrator (Kiro sdlc-*, Claude main)→ READ-ONLY except a single branch/worktree create
  restricted   (analyst/architect/qa/…)  → READ-ONLY, no exceptions

CONTRACT: reads the hook JSON on stdin; exit 0 = allow, exit 2 = block (fail-closed on parse error).
Self-test: `python3 check-shell-command.py --self-test` (covers Kiro + Claude vectors).
