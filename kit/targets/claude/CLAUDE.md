# {{PROJECT_TITLE}} — SDLC kit (Claude Code)

This project runs the **dual-target SDLC kit** on Claude Code. The orchestrator is the **main
session**, driven by a slash command; it spawns one-shot role subagents per phase and pauses for you
at each gate.

## Entry points

- **Full flow** (feature · cr · rebuild, S1→S6): `/sdlc-full <slug> ticket <id>`
- **Fast track** (bugfix · hotfix): `/sdlc-fast bugfix <slug>` · `/sdlc-fast hotfix <slug>`
- **Manage a running pipeline**: `approve` · `nogo <reason>` · `status` · `continue` ·
  `dispute bug #N — <claim>`
- **Project setup / context**: run `/onboarder` first on a new project (drafts `.claude/context/`,
  returns a Facts-to-commit table for your sign-off).
- **Run a single role directly** (D3): `/analyst` · `/architect` · `/developer` · `/qa` ·
  `/onboarder` — each spawns that one-shot role subagent with the active change's CPP baton. These
  run ONE phase and do **not** gate/advance the pipeline; use `/sdlc-full … approve` to gate.

> 🚫 **Invariant:** only the **developer** subagent writes code. The main session (orchestrator) and
> the analyst/architect/qa/onboarder subagents treat the shell as read-only and write only specs/
> artifacts. This is enforced by the `agent_type`-keyed PreToolUse hooks in `.claude/settings.json`
> (a subagent's `agent_type` is present; the main session's is absent ⇒ it is the orchestrator).

## Notes

- **Stack-specific packs** (laravel / nestjs / nextjs, etc.) ship under `.claude/stacks/<stack>/`
  (a `preset.json` + `context/` + `skills/`). Activate one with
  `node .claude/tools/apply-stack.mjs <stack>` (`--list` to see them): it seeds
  `.claude/context/{stack,conventions}.md` and copies the pack's skills into `.claude/skills/`,
  where they become **model-invoked skills** that load only when relevant. They are intentionally
  NOT `@import`ed here — keeps every session's base context small (see MIGRATION.md §7 Q2). On
  Claude there is no `context-map.json` wiring step (skills auto-discover); that is Kiro-only.
- The OpenSpec workspace (`openspec/`) is the spec backend; `.claude/sdlc.config.json` +
  `.claude/pipelines.json` configure gates, rigor, and the phase pipeline.
- After updating the kit, re-run `npx kiro-sdlc-init . --force` and start a **new session** — agents,
  commands, settings, and hooks load at session start, not mid-session.
