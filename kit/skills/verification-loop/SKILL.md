# Verification Loop — {{PROJECT_TITLE}}

Verification system gắn vào SDLC gates. Chạy trước khi tạo PR (S4) hoặc khi QA review (S5).

## When to Use

- After completing a feature (S4 Build → before PR)
- Before QA handoff (S4 → S5 transition)
- After refactoring
- Periodic check during long sessions (every 15 min)

## Verification Phases

### Phase 1: Build
```bash
# Backend
npm run build 2>&1 | tail -20
# Frontend
npm run build 2>&1 | tail -20
```
If fail → STOP and fix.

### Phase 2: Type Check
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -30
```

### Phase 3: Lint
```bash
# Backend
npm run lint 2>&1 | head -30

# Frontend
npm run lint 2>&1 | head -30
```

### Phase 4: Tests + Coverage
```bash
# Backend
npx vitest run --coverage 2>&1 | tail -50
# Target: ≥80% (P1 standard)
```

### Phase 5: Security Scan
```bash
# Hardcoded secrets
grep -rn "sk_\|api_key\|password\s*=" --include="*.ts" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Console.log in production code
grep -rn "console.log" --include="*.ts" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

### Phase 6: Diff Review
```bash
git diff --stat
git diff HEAD~1 --name-only
```

Review for: unintended changes, missing error handling, edge cases.
